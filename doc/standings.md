# Standings and playoff qualification rules

## Point calculations

### 1996-1999
Prior to the 2000 season, MLS matches could not result in draws. After 90
minutes (without stoppage time, as matches used a countdown clock that stopped
when the ball was out-of-play), teams entered into a five-a-side, 35 yard
shootout with the winner awarded one point.

* Win: 3 points
* Shootout win: 1 point
* Loss: 0 points

### 2000-

* Win: 3 points
* Draw: 1 point
* Loss: 0 points


## Playoff qualification and tiebreakers

### 2015-

* 12 teams qualify for the playoffs: the top six teams in each conference that
  have the most points in the standings at the end of the regular season.
* The top six teams in each conference are seeded first to sixth in their
  respective six-team playoff conference brackets.
* Top two teams get byes; third through sixth place teams in each conference
  play in the first round.

Tiebreakers:

# misc notes

"Unlike past seasons, head-to-head competition results are not used in tie-breakers, since the 2012 season."


this applies to old format with reseeding? -- "If two clubs remain tied after another club with the same number of points advances during any step, the tie breaker reverts to step 1 of the two-club format."
